# **Learning Objectives** 
*** 
In this section, discuss the data science and statistical skills, methods, and concepts that will be covered by this case study. An example from the CO2 emissions case study is provided here: 

In this case study, we will explore CO2 emission data from around the world. 
We will also focus on the US specifically to evaluate patterns of temperatures and natural disaster activity. 

This case study will particularly focus on how to use different datasets that span different ranges of time, as well as how to create visualizations of patterns over time. 
We will especially focus on using packages and functions from the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"}, such as `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2`. 

The tidyverse is a library of packages created by RStudio. 
While some students may be familiar with previous R programming packages, these packages make data science in R especially legible and intuitive.

The skills, methods, and concepts that students will be familiar with by the end of this case study are:

<u>**Data Science Learning Objectives:**</u>  

1. Importing data from various types of Excel files and CSV files
2. Apply action verbs in `dplyr` for data wrangling
3. How to pivot between "long" and "wide" datasets
4. Joining together multiple datasets using `dplyr`
5. How to create effective longitudinal data visualizations with `ggplot2`
6. How to add text, color, and labels to `ggplot2` plots
7. How to create faceted `ggplot2` plots

<u>**Statistical Learning Objectives:**</u>  

1. Introduction to correlation coefficient as a summary statistic
2. Relationship between correlation and linear regression
3. Correlation is not causation

```{r, out.width = "20%", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/logo.png")
```


*** 
After discussing the learning objectives, load all the packages used in the case study analysis in the code chunk below:

We will begin by loading the packages that we will need:

```{r}
library(here)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
```


Provide a link to the source and briefly explain its use for each package in the following table:

 Package   | Use                                                                         
---------- |-------------
[here](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here){target="_blank"}       | to easily load and save data
[readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"}      | to import the CSV file data


The first time we use a function, we will use the `::` to indicate which package we are using. Unless we have overlapping function names, this is not necessary, but we will include it here to be informative about where the functions we will use come from.

# **Context**
*** 
Provide some more details and background on the case study topic and its relation to public health/the world. 

# **Limitations**
*** 
Describe any limitations that exist in this analysis whether it be due to the data itself, methods used, nature of the topic, etc. 

There are some important considerations regarding this data analysis to keep in mind: 

1) Limitation 1  

2) Limitation 2  


# **What are the data?**
*** 
Describe the data to be analyzed and where it came from in this section.

If you want to make a table about variable info, use the following table template:

Variable   | Details                                                                        
---------- |-------------
**variable1**  | Variable info  <br> -- more details <br> -- more details <br>  **Example**: Content content  
**variable2**  | Variable info  <br> -- more details <br> -- more details <br>  **Example**: Content content

# **Data Import**
*** 
Describe how to import your case study data files into R or Python:

Within your case study project folder, put the data files as they came from the source into a 'data/raw/' subfolder and use the `here` package. See the following example: 

```{r}
pm <-readr::read_csv(here("data", "raw", "pm25_data.csv"))
```

At the end of the data import section, save the imported data as .rda files to allow users to stop and pick up where they left off: 

```{r}
save(pm, file = here::here("data", "imported", "pm25_data_imported.rda"))
```


# **Data Exploration and Wrangling**
*** 
At the beginning of the section, include the following message:

If you have been following along but stopped, we could load our imported data like so:

```{r}
load(here::here("data", "imported", "pm25_data_imported.rda"))
```

Also provide guidance for users who may have skipped the previous section, see the following example: 

***
<details> <summary> If you skipped the data import section click here. </summary>

An RDA version (stands for R data) of the data can be found [here](https://github.com//opencasestudies/ocs-bp-co2-emissions/tree/master/data/imported) or slightly more directly [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencasestudies/ocs-bp-co2-emissions/master/data/imported/co2_data_imported.rda). Download this file and then place it in your current working directory within a subdirectory called "imported" within a directory called "data" to use the following code. We used an RStudio project and the [`here` package](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here) to navigate to the file more easily.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
load(here::here("data", "imported", "co2_data_imported.rda"))
```

</details>
***

Use this section to walk through any exploration of the data conducted pre-analysis. Then, explain step-by-step the data wrangling process used to prepare the data for analysis. Note that not all case studies include a data exploration. Data exploration and wrangling may also be split into two sections. 

We will also use the `%>%` pipe which can be used to define the input for later sequential steps. This will make more sense when we have multiple sequential steps using the same data object. To use the pipe notation we need to install and load dplyr as well.

Can include DT tables too: 

```{r}
library(DT)
DT::datatable(iris)
```

(note that you can`t use these inside a click expand details section.)

Scrollable content:

#### {.scrollable }
```{r}
# Scroll through the output!
pm %>% 
  distinct(state) %>%
  print(n = 1e3)
```
####


To make click expand section use:

<details><summary> Click here to see more info </summary>

text text

</details>

Note!!! You cannot use scroll features inside detail sections unless it is the last header section! Otherwise it will cause the other headers to be missing and other issues. 

You can still do this if you leave an open details section like this and then have a section header at the same level as this section:

<details><summary> Click here to see more info </summary>

text text

Scrollable content:

#### {.scrollable }
```{r}
# Scroll through the output!
pm %>% 
  distinct(state) %>%
  print(n = 1e3)
```
####

At the end of this section, include the following:

To allow users to skip import and wrangling we will save the data as an RDA file as well as a CSV file as this is often useful to send our data to collaborators. We will save this in a “wrangled” subdirectory of our “data” directory of our working directory.

```{r}
save(pm, file = here::here("data", "wrangled", "wrangled_data.rda")) 
readr::write_csv(pm, path = here::here("data","wrangled", "wrangled_data.csv"))
```

Replace `pm` with the name of the data object created at the end of data wrangling. 

# **Data Visualization**
*** 
At the beginning of the section, include the following message:

If you have been following along but stopped, we could load our wrangled data like so:

```{r}
load(here::here("data", "wrangled", "wrangled_data.rda"))
```

Also provide guidance for users who may have skipped the previous section, see the following example: 

***
<details> <summary> If you skipped the data import section click here. </summary>

An RDA file (stands for R data) of the data can be found [here](https://github.com//opencasestudies/ocs-bp-co2-emissions/tree/master/data/wrangled) or slightly more directly [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencasestudies/ocs-bp-co2-emissions/master/data/wrangled/wrangled_data.rda). Download this file and then place it in your current working directory within a subdirectory called "wrangled" within a subdirectory called "data" to use the following code. We used an RStudio project and the [`here` package](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here) to navigate to the file more easily.


```{r}
load(here::here("data", "wrangled", "wrangled_data.rda"))
```

</details>
***

Use this section to walk through step by step how the wrangled data was visualized. Explain how these visualizations improve understanding and help extract insights. 

If any further wrangling was conducted in this section, please save the most recent version of the data similar to previous sections. 

# **Data Analysis**
*** 
At the beginning of the section, include the following message:

If you have been following along but stopped, we could load our wrangled data like so:

```{r}
